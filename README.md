#Bliss Translator 1.0.0

A live updating translator of speech to [BlissSymbolics][bliss_website]. 

Features not added in this release:

1.    Verb tenses: all verbs are unconjugated in their Bliss dictionary, so there needs to be a module that converts conjugations to their root form. 
2.    Non- English support: Blissymbolics have characters associated with non English languages, which makes it easy to add support for other languages
3.    Gendered Words: Blissymbolics is gendered, but my project doesnâ€™t account for this
4.    Synonyms: Not all words have a direct Bliss Symbol, but they do have a likely synonym. I also did this in NLTK Wordnet
5.    Contextual understanding: my project does not have context dependent symbol selection
